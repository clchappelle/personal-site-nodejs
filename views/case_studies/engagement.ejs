      <h5>The problem</h5>
      <h3 class="section-title">Cutting through the noise</h3>
      <p class="p--large">Bright Funds is a for-profit, for-good enterprise product that companies use to run their giving and volunteering benefits. What we were seeing from our data and hearing from the people running giving and volunteering programs was that people love the benefits we offer, but they were being under used.</p>
      <p class="p--large">People are busy at work (that’s a good thing!). But as a result, soft benefits like having your donations matched were slipping through the cracks. We would see an uptick during certain seasons (IE holiday giving), but see engagement slip during other parts of the year.</p>

      <h3>The challenge</h3>
      <p>Develop a process to discover and quickly test projects that boost awareness of Bright Funds within companies and increase engagement once an employee begins using the product.</p>

      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>An engineer and I took up the challenge to understand why benefits like this were being under-used and to iterate through possible features that could boost awareness and engagement.</p>
      <p>My role included</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collecting and ranking engagement ideas</li>
        <li>Project planning and scope definition</li>
        <li>Experience design</li>
        <li>UI design</li>

      <h5>Shaping the idea</h5>
      <h3>Researching the problem</h3>
      <p>To get started, I held conversations with employees, looked at usage data, and read through customer support conversations to understand what was holding people back from using their giving and volunteer benefits - especially because most people are already doing this outside of work.</p>

      <h3>Early insights</h3>
      <p>From this research, we identified several key insights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overall awareness within companies can be low.</strong><br>People are busy with their work and daily lives. Often, giving benefits are explained as part of an employee’s onboarding, but people are already way too overloaded in those first few weeks. Giving and matching doesn’t stick.</li>
        <li><strong>People often only log in once per year.</strong><br>Many companies run a service week or end of year giving campaign where they drum up awareness. After that many people don’t come back.</li>
        <li><strong>People don’t know everything they can do.</strong><br>For example, we get people reaching out with questions like: “I made a donation to a friend’s race, can that be matched?”. As a result, people don't take full advantage of the product.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These problems result in people leaving matching on the table that they could have used or not taking advantage of their volunteer benefits.</p>

      <h3>From problem to opportunity</h3>
      <p>I repositioned these problems into opportunities.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>How might we make people within companies aware of the benefits available to them?</li>
        <li>How might boost engagement of company giving and volunteering benefits throughout the year?</li>
        <li>How might help people take full advantage of all the giving and volunteering benefits they have?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Next, we began thinking through possible solutions for these opportunities.</p>

      <h3>Gathering ideas</h3>
      <p>First, I needed to gather ideas for how we might act on these opportunities. How we might increase awareness, increase retention, and help people take full advantage of the benefits available to them. To do so, I decided to collect ideas from throughout the company.</p>
      <p>Valuable insights live within various teams. For example, customer support might know which features come up frequently in support conversations and what users aren't quite understanding. Sales might know how companies are looking to increase awareness within their company.</p>
      <p>To gather ideas from around the company, I developed a pitch document. When someone had an idea they’d like to share, they wrote out what the idea was, why they think it would be effective, and how it could be measured. This document was then shared in a slack channel.</p>
      <p>The purpose behind writing out the idea was to encourage concrete thinking. This way, once the team was ready to review which projects to take on, we had a good idea of the work that would be required to make something happen and what success looks like.</p>

      <h3>Choosing projects</h3>
      <p>A group from the product team would meet every few weeks and discuss ideas that had been submitted.</p>
      <p>There’s not one magic method to decide on which projects to take on. In this case, we made decisions based on what we believed would have high impact, what would be within our desired effort to build (we wanted to keep each project small, around 2-4 weeks work), and whether we’ve heard specific requests from clients.</p>

      <h3>Onboarding</h3>
      <p>Focus: <span class="definition-badge">Understanding features</span></p>
      <p>The first time someone logs in is a critical moment. Our job is to help that person get to the ‘aha’ moment of understanding why this product deserves a spot in their life. Some pieces of the onboarding process were working ok, but we knew we could do better.</p>
      <p>To guide someone through their initial experience, we developed an onboarding 'happy path'. We then translated this happy path into an onboarding checklist.</p>
      <p>For example, if a new user shares their skills and interests, we can follow up with that person with volunteer opportunities that would be a perfect fit for them. This light weight investment of effort that could deliver long-term value. A perfect onboarding task.</p>
      <p>We also knew that people were most likely to come back to Bright Funds if they had used the product previously to support a nonprofit. Therefore, one of the checklist items was to find their first nonprofit to volunteer with or donate to. This action was higher effort, but was an important step in understanding the core product value.</p>
      <p>This checklist helps someone understand what they can do and celebrates early accomplishments along the way.</p>

      <h3>Tips and advice</h3>
      <p>Focus: <span class="definition-badge">Understanding features</span></p>
      <p>We knew that people weren’t fully aware of everything they could do on Bright Funds. Matching donations to fundraisers, setting up automatic donations, giving through payroll. These came up frequently through support conversations. </p>
      <p>Once someone did decide to use Bright Funds, we had opportunities to deliver personalized advice. Say you have $1,000 of matching and are giving $50 per month. Over the course of the year, you’ll be leaving $400 of matching on the table. If I wanted to use all of my matching, I would need to do the monthly calculations myself.</p>
      <p>Helping someone understand what they could do would help them take full advantage of their various benefits. Helping them make better decisions would deliver higher value.</p>
      <p>We worked through these two types of tips. Educational tips (What can I do) and contextual advice (What do you suggest).</p>
      <p>I looked at a few visual treatments for the educational tips. We wanted them to be prominent, but not get in the way. For example, we knew that if we periodically displayed a modal with tips people would likely close out that modal because it's interrupting the task they came in to do.</p>
      <p>Every user’s account has a home page. I decided to take over the header of this page with the tips. By doing so, the tips were prominent, they didn’t get in the way, and they take up additional screen real estate. </p>

      <p>The first round of contextual advice was focussed on helping someone use their donation matching. If someone was making a donation we display how much matching would be available afterwards. By doing so, they could decide whether to change how much they’re giving.</p>
      <p>If someone was making a recurring donation, we show how much that person could give monthly to take advantage of their full year’s matching.</p>

      <h3>Fundraising</h3>
      <p>Focus: <span class="definition-badge">Awareness</span>, <span class="definition-badge">Frequency of usage</span></p>
      <p>We knew that the awareness of giving and matching programs could be pretty low within companies. Soft benefits like these aren’t critical to someone’s work and they don’t earn the same attention as benefits like insurance and retirement savings.</p>
      <p>We wanted to increase awareness. At the same time, we were wary of a traditional awareness campaign, because each company handled their internal comms differently. Company A might use email, company B Slack, company C an internally built tool. On top of that, each company would likely want to control what they say, how they say it, and when. At the same time, we didn’t want to invest effort in a project that would result in messages silently landing in inboxes.</p>
      <p>However, we did know that fundraising is a key driver for giving. Fundraising for a birthday, for a race, or for a personal reason is extremely popular (IE Facebook fundraisers, charity: water, GoFundMe). Fundraisers are also inherently social. We figured this could be a natural growth mechanism within companies.</p>
      <p>Our hunch was that we could encourage people to fundraise on Bright Funds with the knowledge that donations would be matched (therefore doubling the amount raised). This could be a trojan horse. The coworkers that supported the fundraiser would then be introduced to Bright Funds and could learn about the other benefits available to them.</p>
      <p>At the time, people could set up Funds - think mutual funds for giving. We decided to adapt this concept to allow adding a goal and a deadline to test fundraisers.</p>

      <h3>Goal setting</h3>
      <p>Focus: <span class="definition-badge">Frequency of usage</span></p>
      <p>Based on research from other fields (especially retirement saving) we were interested to see whether having someone set a goal for how much they’d like to give would result in them giving more or giving more often. </p>
      <p>The problem we were seeing was that many employees (let’s call her Rachel) would usually make one-time donations sporadically throughout the year. She donates when her company runs a giving or volunteer campaign, and then beyond that perhaps only when she’s asked by friends. At the same time, we heard that people like Rachel thought they should be giving more.</p>
      <p>Our hypothesis was that if we prompted people to set a goal for how much they'd like to give over the course of a year and then make it easy for her to follow up with her intentions, she would be more likely to give more and more often.</p>
      <p>Here's how we tested this feature: When Rachel logs in, she can set a goal. First, she selects which percentage of her salary she’d be interested in giving. We provide a benchmark of 6% based on research indicating that is how much people believe others should give.</p>

      <div class="case-study__content-wrapper--md grid--centered-sm" data-aos="fade-up">

      <p>Then she selects her income range. We decided on income ranges rather than exact income to combat privacy concerns people may have.</p>

      <p>To make the next step actionable, we provide a few suggested ways to donate. Knowing that Rachel might be wary of donating on the spot, we also have an option to send a reminder in a month.</p>
      <p>Progress toward the goal was displayed on Rachel’s account whenever she logged in. She also received a few emails throughout the year with feedback about her progress.</p>

        <h3>Positive results</h3>
        <p>This series of product updates not only spurred more donations throughout the year, but were also loved by our customers and internal teams. When comparing monthly donations to the previous year, we saw a growth of over 10%. Personalized tips, advice, and goals made our product tailored to each person’s unique reasons for giving. We saw teams within companies running fundraisers through Bright Funds ranging from annual yoga festivals, pride month, and Relay for Life. And the onboarding checklist provided a framework that the team could tweak to better guide users through the product.</p>

        <p>There was also much more to do. We purposefully limited the size of each project to around two weeks. That meant keeping a close eye on what was in scope. Especially with tips and goal setting, there was a lot we could do to provide the best personalized advice. Understanding what someone cares about, how they view giving, and what their life is like all can help us serve up unique suggestions on how they could give. However, we made the decision at the start to get work out the door and iterate further later. This projects provided the basis for the team to grow and experiment with.</p>
